## 3 - Movie ratings dataset <img align="left" src="./images/film_rating.png"     style=" width:40px;  " >
The data set is derived from the [MovieLens "ml-latest-small"](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) dataset.   
[F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1â€“19:19. <https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872>]

The original dataset has  9742 movies rated by 617 users. The dataset has been reduced in size to focus on movies from the years since 2000. This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 0.5 to 5 in 0.5 step increments. The reduced dataset has $n_u = 443$ users, and $n_m= 4778$ movies. 

You need to load the movie dataset into the variables $Y$ and $R$.

The matrix $Y$ (a  $n_m \times n_u$ matrix) stores the ratings $y^{(i,j)}$. The matrix $R$ is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i,j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, and $R(i,j)=0$ otherwise. 

Throughout this part of the process, we will also be working with the
matrices, $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{W}$ and $\mathbf{b}$: 

$$\mathbf{X} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
--- (\mathbf{x}^{(0)})^T --- \\
--- (\mathbf{x}^{(1)})^T --- \\
\vdots \\
--- (\mathbf{x}^{(n_m-1)})^T --- \\
\end{bmatrix} , \quad
\mathbf{W} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
--- (\mathbf{w}^{(0)})^T --- \\
--- (\mathbf{w}^{(1)})^T --- \\
\vdots \\
--- (\mathbf{w}^{(n_u-1)})^T --- \\
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\mathbf{ b} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
 b^{(0)}  \\
 b^{(1)} \\
\vdots \\
b^{(n_u-1)} \\
\end{bmatrix}\quad
$$ 

The $i$-th row of $\mathbf{X}$ corresponds to the
feature vector $x^{(i)}$ for the $i$-th movie, and the $j$-th row of
$\mathbf{W}$ corresponds to one parameter vector $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$, for the
$j$-th user. Both $x^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ are $n$-dimensional
vectors. For the purposes of this exercise, you will use $n=10$, and
therefore, $\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ and $\mathbf{w}^{(j)}$ have 10 elements.
Correspondingly, $\mathbf{X}$ is a
$n_m \times 10$ matrix and $\mathbf{W}$ is a $n_u \times 10$ matrix.

We will start by loading the movie ratings dataset to understand the structure of the data.
We will load $Y$ and $R$ with the movie dataset.  
We'll also load $\mathbf{X}$, $\mathbf{W}$, and $\mathbf{b}$ with pre-computed values. These values will be learned later in the lab, but we'll use pre-computed values to develop the cost model.
